# Offline

This package can work offline, but only if some features are not used:

 * Playlists that use a date/time in their schedule will not work unless
 the the device got a correct system time using NTP. Alternatively it
 is possible to use a hardware based RTC to store time across reboots.
 * Anything using remote content will not work. This includes the browser,
 frab and streaming abilities.
